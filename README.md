#### Main
- Use tabs to switch between athletes, teams, sports, events and olympic games
- Use search bar on the top right to filter entries (Shows everything containing the search string e.g. "1980 Summer" can be found with "1980", "Summer", "80 Su" ...)
- When changing tabs or using the search, the amount of found entries gets refreshed
- While in "Athletes" tab, double clicking an entry shows more details about the athlete. Alternatively navigation with the up/down arrows and enter is possible.

#### Athlete information
- Shows basic information about the athlete
- Calculates last event and shows last age, last height and last weight
- All events in which the athlete was involved are displayed in a table
- By clicking "Add Event" the new entry window shows up with pre-inserted values of the athlete (Name, Sex, Team, Last age, Last height, Last weight)

#### Add entry
- Can be accessed in two ways
- Either shows blank fields to add a new athlete with one event.
- Or shows pre-filled fields to add an event to an existing athlete.
- There is no field for the id, because when adding events, it stays the same and when adding athletes it gets generated anyway.
